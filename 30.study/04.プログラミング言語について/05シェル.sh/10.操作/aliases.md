Not long time ago I have rediscovered an old friend - Bash1 the Alias2. We were never best friends until now. We got acquainted at the beginning of my computer science studies. I visited back then a course held by Cisco, "Linux Essentials" or something like that. The trainer mentioned at one point what were aliases and how handy they could be. Well 12 years later, and I still had not gotten that, until recently, when the alias presented himself in a new light to me. Since then we've been best friends. Read on to learn why.
