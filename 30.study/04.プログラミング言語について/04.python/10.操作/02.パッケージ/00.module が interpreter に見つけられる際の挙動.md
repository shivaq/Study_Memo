# モジュールファイルを探す
- the `import modu` statement will look for the proper file, which is `modu.py` in the same directory as the caller if it exists. 

- If it is not found, 
the Python interpreter will search for modu.py in the “path” recursively 

- and raise an ImportError exception if it is not found.

# 見つけたファイル内のコンポーネントを収集する
- Once modu.py is found, the Python interpreter will execute the module in an isolated scope.
Any top-level statement in modu.py will be executed, including other imports if any.

- Function and class definitions are stored in the module’s dictionary.

# モジュールのコンポーネントが利用可能となる
- Then, the module’s variables, functions, and classes will be available to the caller through the module’s `namespace`, a central concept in programming that is particularly helpful and powerful in Python.




## モジュールの namespace
- Python における include の挙動は他の言語と違う

In many languages, an include file directive is used by the preprocessor to take all code found in the file and ‘copy’ it into the caller’s code. It is different in Python:

## include されたコードは isolated

the included code is isolated in a module namespace, which means that you generally don’t have to worry that the included code could have unwanted effects, e.g. override an existing function with the same name.
