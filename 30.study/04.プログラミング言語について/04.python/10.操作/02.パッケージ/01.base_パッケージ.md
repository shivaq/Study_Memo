# import pack.modu の挙動
## まずは __init__ を見る
- This statement will look for an __init__.py file in pack
- and execute all of its top-level statements.

## 次に pack/modu.py を見る
- Then it will look for a file named pack/modu.py
- and execute all of its top-level statements. After these operations, any variable, function, or class defined in modu.py is available in the pack.modu namespace.



## Leaving an __init__.py file empty is considered normal and even a good practice,
- if the package’s modules and sub-packages do not need to share any code.

## import very.deep.module as mod
- This allows you to use mod in place of the verbose repetition of very.deep.module.
