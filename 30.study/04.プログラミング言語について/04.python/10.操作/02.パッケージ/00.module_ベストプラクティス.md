# from some import somefunc もベストではない


Better
```py
from modu import sqrt
[...]
x = sqrt(4)  # sqrt may be part of modu, if not redefined in between
```

Best
```py
import modu
[...]
x = modu.sqrt(4)  # sqrt is visibly part of modu's namespace
```


## import * はよくない
It is possible to simulate the more standard behavior by using a special syntax of the import statement: `from modu import *`. This is generally considered bad practice. Using import * makes code harder to read and makes dependencies less compartmentalized.

Using from modu import func is a way to pinpoint the function you want to import and put it in the local namespace. While much less harmful than import * because it shows explicitly what is imported in the local namespace, its only advantage over a simpler import modu is that it will save a little typing.
