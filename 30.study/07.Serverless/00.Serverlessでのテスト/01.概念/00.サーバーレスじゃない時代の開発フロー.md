They analyze a new feature.

For less complex features, they start with the code, then they run it locally and add some tests in the end.

For more complex features, they do their version of TDD: they start with tests, then write the code, and test it locally.

When the feature is ready, it goes to the CI tool that deploys it to the testing environment.

Then the QA team takes a new feature for another round of manual testing. If everything looks good, the app goes through CI to production.
