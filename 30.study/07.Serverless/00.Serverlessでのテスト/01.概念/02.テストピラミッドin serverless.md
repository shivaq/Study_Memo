A lot of unit tests, because they are the cheapest (fastest to write and run)

Fewer integration tests, because they are more expensive, and they take more time to run

A few UI tests, because they are the most expensive (requires some GUI tool) and slowest to run

Besides these, they also have manual session-based testing, done by their QA team.
