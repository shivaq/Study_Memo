# Security
## authentication
* Your services need to know to whom they are talking (authentication)

## authorization
* what data and operations are permitted (authorization) to said identity.



### Let the IP network protect the services
* if you run all of your microservices on a protected network, and you want to transfer trust to your development staff to not abuse access, then this might work for you.
* Keep in mind that a breach of a single service implies full access to all other services.

### Service-level authentication
* shared keys or certificate-based authentication allows a called service to validate a calling service.
* You will need a secure way to distribute and update keys and certificates to keep this secure. Use a Key Management Service.

### User-level authentication
* not only are services talking to services, but they are quite often talking on behalf of a user or even directly to a user.
* There must be a means of authenticating and authorizing the user-level credential to the resource at hand.

### Start simple
* this is an area that can break an organization out the gate, and it is probably best to start simple.
* You likely already have a few different services that talk to one another,
* and you are likely using some IP access-control lists to protect them.
* Start simple, add to the complexity as a natural evolution of the system.
