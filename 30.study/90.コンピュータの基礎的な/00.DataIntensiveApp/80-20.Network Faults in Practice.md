# Network Faults in Practice
## コンピュータネットワークの歴史は何十年にもなるが、それは未だ reliable とは言えない
* We have been building computer networks for decades
* one might hope that by now we would have figured out how to make them reliable.
* However, it seems that we have not yet succeeded.

## どんだけ奴らが reliable ではないか、の話
* There are some systematic studies, and plenty of anecdotal evidence, showing that network problems can be surprisingly common, even in controlled environments like a datacenter operated by one company
* One study in a medium-sized datacenter found about 12 network faults per month,
* of which half disconnected a single machine
* and half disconnected an entire rack [15].
* Another study measured the failure rates of components like top-of-rack switches, aggregation switches, and load balancers [16].
* It found that adding redundant networking gear doesn’t reduce faults as much as you might hope
* since it doesn’t guard against human error (e.g., misconfigured switches), which is a major cause of outages.
* Public cloud services such as EC2 are notorious for having frequent transient network glitches
* and well-managed private datacenter networks can be stabler environments
* Nevertheless, nobody is immune from network problems:
* for example, a problem during a software upgrade for a switch could trigger a network topology reconfiguration,
* during which network packets could be delayed for more than a minute
* Sharks might bite undersea cables and damage them [18].
* Other surprising faults include a network interface that sometimes drops all inbound packets but sends outbound packets successfully
* just because a network link works in one direction doesn’t guarantee it’s also working in the opposite direction.

#### Network partitions
* When one part of the network is cut off from the rest due to a net work fault
* that is sometimes called a network partition or netsplit.
* In this book we’ll generally stick with the more general term network fault, to avoid confusion with partitions (shards) of a storage system, as discussed in Chapter 6.



#### いつか来るNetwork fault に備えるべし
* Even if network faults are rare in your environment, the fact that faults can occur means that your software needs to be able to handle them.

#### それを絶対回避する、ということはできない
* Whenever any communication happens over a network, it may fail—there is no way around it.それはいつか起こるから。

## エラーハンドリングを定義して、テストせよ！
* If the error handling of network faults is not defined and tested, arbitrarily bad things could happen:
## 意図的にネットワーク上の問題を起こしてテストせよ
* 失敗は必ず起こる
* 起きても問題ないシステムであるべきである
* ランダムにネットワーク fault を起こしても問題ないはずだ
* ランダムに問題を起こして、問題ないことを常に確信している状態にする。それが fault 強者な組織を作る →カオスモンキー

#### 悪いことが起きるよ。。。
* the cluster could become deadlocked and permanently unable to serve requests, even when the network recovers
* it could even delete all of your data
* If software is put in an unanticipated situation, it may do arbitrary unexpected things.

### Handling network faults doesn’t necessarily mean tolerating them
#### ネットワークが reliable ならば
* if your network is normally fairly reliable, a valid approach may be to simply show an error message to users while your network is experiencing problems.

#### ネットワークでの問題発生時に、そのソフトウェアがどう反応するかを熟知せよ
* you do need to know how your software reacts to network problems and ensure that the system can recover from them.
