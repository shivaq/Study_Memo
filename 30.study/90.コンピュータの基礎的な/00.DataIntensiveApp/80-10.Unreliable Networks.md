# Unreliable Networks

# shared-nothing systems
* the distributed systems we focus on in this book are shared-nothing systems
* i.e., a bunch of machines connected by a network. The network is the only way those machines can communicate
* we assume that each machine has its own memory and disk
* and one machine cannot access another machine’s memory or disk (except by making requests to a service over the network).
* Shared-nothing is not the only way of building systems,
* but it has become the dominant approach for building internet services for several reasons:

* it’s comparatively cheap because it requires no special hardware
* it can make use of commoditized cloud computing services
### distributed datacenters
* and it can achieve high reliability through redundancy across multiple geographically distributed datacenters.
* The internet and most internal networks in datacenters (often Ethernet) are asynchronous packet networks.
* In this kind of network, one node can send a message (a packet) to another node,
* but the network gives no guarantees as to when it will arrive, or whether it will arrive at all.
* If you send a request and expect a response, many things could go wrong (some of which are illustrated in Figure 8-1):

## Trust NO network
1. Your request may have been lost (perhaps someone unplugged a network cable).
2. Your request may be waiting in a queue and will be delivered later (perhaps the network or the recipient is overloaded).
3. The remote node may have failed (perhaps it crashed or it was powered down).
4. The remote node may have temporarily stopped responding (perhaps it is experiencing a long garbage collection pause; see “Process Pauses” on page 295), but it will start responding again later.
5. The remote node may have processed your request, but the response has been lost on the network (perhaps a network switch has been misconfigured).
6. The remote node may have processed your request, but the response has been delayed and will be delivered later (perhaps the network or your own machine is overloaded).

* The sender can’t even tell whether the packet was delivered:
* the only option is for the recipient to send a response message,
* which may in turn be lost or delayed.
* These issues are **indistinguishable** in an asynchronous network:
* the only information you have is that you haven’t received a response yet.
* If you send a request to another node and don’t receive a response, it is impossible to tell why.
* The usual way of handling this issue is a timeout:
* after some time you give up waiting and assume that the response is not going to arrive. * However, when a timeout occurs, you still don’t know whether the remote node got your request or not (and if the request is still queued somewhere, it may still be delivered to the recipient, even if the sender has given up on it).
