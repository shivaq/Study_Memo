# ■ Two-Phase Locking (2PL)
* strong strict two-phase locking (SS2PL) とも呼ばれる
+ 30 年くらい、serializability in databases ではだいたいこれが使われていた




*
**locks** are often used to **prevent dirty writes**:
if two transactions concurrently try to write to the same object,
the lock ensures that
**the second writer must wait**
until the first one has finished its transaction (aborted or committed)
before it may continue.

*
Two-phase locking is similar,
Several transactions are allowed to concurrently read the same object
as long as **nobody is writing to it**.
But as soon as **anyone wants to write** (modify or delete) an object,
**exclusive access** is required:

## exclusive access
1.
If transaction A has read an object
and transaction B wants to write to that object,
**B must wait** until A commits or aborts before it can continue. (This ensures that B can’t change the object unexpectedly behind A’s back.)

2.
If transaction **A has written an object** and transaction **B wants to read that object**, **B must wait until A commits or aborts** before it can continue. (Reading an old version of the object, like in Figure 7-1, is not acceptable under 2PL.)

In 2PL, **writers don’t just block other writers**;
**they also block readers** and vice versa.

#### Snapshot isolation has the mantra
**readers never block writers**,
and **writers never block readers** (see “Implementing snapshot isolation” on page 239),
which captures this key difference between snapshot isolation and two-phase locking.
On the other hand,
because **2PL provides serializability**, it protects against **all the race conditions** discussed earlier, including lost updates and write skew.
