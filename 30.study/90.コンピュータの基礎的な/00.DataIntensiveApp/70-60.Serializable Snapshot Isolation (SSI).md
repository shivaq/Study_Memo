# Serializable Snapshot Isolation (SSI)

This chapter has painted a bleak picture of concurrency control in databases.
On the one hand,

* we have implementations of **serializability that don’t perform well** (two- phase locking)
or don’t scale well (serial execution).
On the other hand,

* we have **weak isolation levels that have good performance, but are prone to various race conditions** (lost updates, write skew, phantoms, etc.).

Are **serializable isolation and good performance** fundamentally at odds with each other?

### an algorithm called serializable snapshot isolation (SSI)
Perhaps not: an algorithm called serializable snapshot isolation (SSI) is very promising. It provides **full serializability**, but has only **a small performance penalty** compared to snapshot isolation. SSI is fairly new: it was **first described in 2008** [40] and is the subject of Michael Cahill’s PhD thesis [51].
Today SSI is **used both in single-node databases** (the serializable isolation level in PostgreSQL since version 9.1 [41]) and **distributed databases** (FoundationDB uses a similar algorithm). As SSI is so young compared to other concurrency control mechanisms, it is still proving its performance in practice, but it has the possibility of being fast enough to become the new default in the future.
