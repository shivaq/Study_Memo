# Building a Reliable System from Unreliable Components

* Error-correcting codes allow digital data to be transmitted accurately across a communication channel that occasionally gets some bits wrong, for example due to radio interference on a wireless network [12].

* IP (the Internet Protocol) is unreliable: it may drop, delay, duplicate, or reorder packets.
* TCP (the Transmission Control Protocol) provides a more reliable transport layer on top of IP:
* it ensures that missing packets are retransmitted, duplicates are eliminated, and packets are reassembled into the order in which they were sent.

* error-correcting codes can deal with a small number of single-bit errors
* but if your signal is swamped by interference, there is a fundamental limit to how much data you can get through your communication channel [13].
* TCP can hide packet loss, duplication, and reordering from you, but it cannot magically remove delays in the network.
* Although the more reliable higher-level system is not perfect, itâ€™s still useful because it takes care of some of the tricky low-level faults
* and so the remaining faults are usually easier to reason about and deal with.
