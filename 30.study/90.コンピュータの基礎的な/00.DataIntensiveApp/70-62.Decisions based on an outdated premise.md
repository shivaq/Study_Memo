# Decisions based on an outdated premise
When we previously discussed **write skew in snapshot isolation**
, we observed a recurring pattern:

a transaction **reads some data** from the database, **examines the result of the query**, and decides to take some action (write to the database) **based on the result that it saw.**

However, under snapshot isolation, the result from the original query may **no longer be up-to-date** by the time the transaction commits, because the data may have been modified in the meantime.

## premise とは
(a fact that was true at the beginning of the transaction, e.g., **There are currently two doctors on call**).

### premise が変わってたら invalid と判断
Put another way, the transaction is taking an action **based on a premise**  Later, when the transaction wants to commit, **the original data may have changed—the premise may no longer be true**.

When the application makes a query (e.g., “How many doctors are currently on call?”), the database doesn’t know how the application logic uses the result of that query. To be safe, **the database needs to assume** that **any change in the query result (the premise)** means that **writes in that transaction may be invalid**. 

In other words, there may be a causal dependency between the queries and the writes in the transaction. In order to provide serializable isolation, the database must detect situations in which **a transaction may have acted on an outdated premise** and abort the transaction in that case.

### How does the database know if a query result might have changed?
There are two cases to consider:

* Detecting reads of a stale MVCC object version (uncommitted write occurred **before the read**)

* Detecting writes that affect prior reads (the write occurs **after the read**)
