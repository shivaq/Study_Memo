#### Detecting Faults
#### 多くのシステムが、faulty なノードを自動検知するシステムを必要としている
* A load balancer needs to stop sending requests to a node that is dead (i.e., take it
out of rotation).
* In a distributed database with single-leader replication, if the leader fails, one of the followers needs to be promoted to be the new leader

### ネットワークって不確実。よって、ノードが生きてるかどうかを知ることも難しい
#### ノードにアクセス可能ならばわかる
* If you can reach the machine on which the node should be running,
* but no process is listening on the destination port (e.g., because the process crashed),
* the operating system will helpfully close or refuse TCP connections
 by sending a RST or FIN packet in reply.
#### ノードがリクエストの処理中にクラッシュしたら、どれくらい処理していたかわからない
* However, if the node crashed while it was handling your request,
* you have no way of knowing how much data was actually processed by the remote node [22].

#### OS さえ生きていれば
* If a node process crashed (or was killed by an administrator)
* but the node’s operating system is still running,
* a script can notify other nodes about the crash
* so that another node can take over quickly without having to wait for a timeout to expire
* For example, HBase does this [23].

#### マネジメントインターフェイスにアクセスすることができるのならば
* If you have access to the management interface of the network switches in your datacenter
* you can query them to detect link failures at a hardware level
*  (e.g., if the remote machine is powered down).
* This option is ruled out if you’re connecting via the internet,
* or if you’re in a shared datacenter with no access to the switches themselves
* or if you can’t reach the management interface due to a network problem.

#### ルーターが反応してくれるなら
* If a router is sure that
* the IP address you’re trying to connect to is unreachable
* it may reply to you with an ICMP Destination Unreachable packet
#### ルーターのfailure 検知能力がなければ
* However, the router doesn’t have a magic failure detection capability
* either—it is subject to the same limitations as other participants of the network.

#### TCP がパケット送信成功を知ったとしても
* Rapid feedback about a remote node being down is useful,
* but you can’t count on it.
* Even if TCP acknowledges that a packet was delivered,
#### アプリがそれを扱う前にクラッシュしているかもでしょ？
* the application may have crashed before handling it.
#### どうしても知りたければ、リクエストに対するポジティブレスポンスをアプリから返すべし
* If you want to be sure that a request was successful, you need a positive response from the application itself [24].

#### 何かが問題が発生していた場合
* Conversely, if something has gone wrong,
* you may get an error response at some level of the stack,
* but in general you have to assume that you will get no response at all.
#### レスポンスがなければエラーだと革新できない？ →リトライとタイムアウトだ
* You can retry a few times (TCP retries transparently, but you may also retry at the application level)
* wait for a timeout to elapse,
* and eventually declare the node dead if you don’t hear back within the timeout.
