# Detecting writes that affect prior reads
The second case to consider is **when another transaction modifies data after it has been read**.

* In the context of two-phase locking we discussed **index-range locks**,   
which **allow the database to lock** access to **all rows matching some search query**, such as WHERE shift_id = 1234.

We can use a similar technique here, except that **SSI locks don’t block other transactions**.

In Figure 7-11, transactions 42 and 43 both search for on-call doctors during shift 1234.

* If there is **an index on shift_id**,   
the database can use the index entry 1234 to record the fact that  
transactions 42 and 43 read this data.   
(**If there is no index**, this information can be tracked at the table level.)

* This information **only needs to be kept** for a while:  
 **after a transaction has finished** (committed or aborted),   
 and **all concurrent transactions have finished**,   
 the **database can forget** what data it read.

* When a transaction writes to the database,   
it must look in the indexes for any other transactions   
that have **recently read the affected data**.

* This process is similar to acquiring a write lock on the affected key range,   
but rather than blocking until the readers have committed,   
the lock acts as a tripwire:

* it simply notifies the transactions that   
the data they read may no longer be up to date.


* In Figure 7-11, **transaction 43** notifies **transaction 42**  
that its prior read is outdated, and vice versa.

* Transaction 42 is first to commit, and it is successful:  
although transaction 43’s write affected 42,  
43 **hasn’t yet committed**, so the write has not yet taken effect.

* However, when transaction 43 wants to commit, **the conflicting write from 42** has already been committed, so 43 must abort.
