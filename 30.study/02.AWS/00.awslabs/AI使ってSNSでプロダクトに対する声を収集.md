# AI-Driven Social Media Dashboard
Voice of customer analytics through social media: Build a social media dashboard using artificial intelligence and business intelligence services.

Organizations want to understand how customers perceive them and who those customers are. For example, what factors are driving the most positive and negative experiences for their offerings? Social media interactions between organizations and customers are a great way to evaluate this and deepen brand awareness. Understanding these conversations are a low-cost way to acquire leads, improve website traffic, develop customer relationships, and improve customer service. Since these conversations are all in unstructured text format, it is difficult to scale the analysis and get the full picture.
