# Amendment X — Reserved Powers
* The powers not delegated to the infrastructure by the macro-architecture are reserved to the individual services respectively, or to the developers of such.



* Do not underestimate the power of this statement.
*
If the macro-architecture does not cover an aspect of the environment, the developers are free to choose and choose they will.
* The more teams you have, the more solutions you will find yourself maintaining.
* Therefore, do two things with your macro-architecture:

## 1. Consider very carefully what you leave out.
* 何を省略するか、について慎重に、慎重に、考えてください
* If you follow the “start small” principle, you are likely not going to be providing a lot of ready-made infrastructures to cover the details of the macro-architecture.
* This is perfectly acceptable.
* However, you can still provide guidance and requirements around those areas in order to minimize the chaos.

# 2. Iterate rapidly
* As the first few services come online, meet and discuss the entire macro-architecture.
* What is working? What is not working? What do you need to change now? (How very agile of me!) Do this on a regular basis. You will hear this again in a few moments.
