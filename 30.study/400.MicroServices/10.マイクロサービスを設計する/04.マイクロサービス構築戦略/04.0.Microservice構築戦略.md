## Microservice 適用時の Strategies

* Build new services with clear value
* Monolithic persistent storage considered harmful
* Decouple “building a service” and “running services”
* Thorough and consistent observability
* Not every new service needs to be built from scratch
* Respect failures because they will happen
* Avoid “microservice syndromes” from day one
