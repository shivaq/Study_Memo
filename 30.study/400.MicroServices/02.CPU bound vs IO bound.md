# CPU bound vs IO bound

## CPU-bound means
* it does a lot of intensive calculations.

## IO-bound, on the other hand, means
* it does something simple like retrieving data from databases,
other systems which use network calls, and such.

## Java, by default,
blocks a thread when it runs IO,
so Java is going to be slow for IO-bound tasks.
