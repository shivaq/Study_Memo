## Everyone should use Microservices.
There, I said it, and I will defend it relentlessly.
Yes, I realize that there are plenty of people, 
likely far smarter and more learned than I am, who state, philosophically:
* If you are not Netflix and you are not Amazon, then the overhead of using a microservices architecture is going to drown you.

* マイクロサービスをうまく使うには、Netflix や Amazon くらいのちからが必要なのだ。。といいうじゃない？
* The notion that I have to be Netflix or Amazon to make productive use of a microservices architecture brings, and I hope you quote me on this, one word to mind: Hogwash.
## ナンセンスでっせ！
