# Conclusion
* The monolithic Node.js app served us well for several years
* but it started slowing us down from shipping great projects and iterating quickly.
* We started to systematically and strategically adopt the microservice architecture.
* We are still in the early stage of this journey, but we have already seen its benefit and potential
* it dramatically increased the development productivity
* allowed us to think big and make substantial product improvement
* and unlocked the engineering team to safely test new technologies.
